# INTRODUCTION

This repository contains my attempts at LeetCode's programming 
problems. Each folder contains two or more files: 

- **problem.md**
- **solution.<language-extention>**

**problem.md** contains the programming problem.
**solution.<language-extention>** will be my attempt at solving the problem. The file extension will change depending on the programming language I choose to solve it in.
